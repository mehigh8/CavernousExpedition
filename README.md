# Cavernous Expedition
<b>Roșu Mihai Cosmin</b>

Cavernous Expedition is a game about cave exploration and puzzle solving. The caves, created using procedural generation, contain different puzzles which have to be solved in order for the player to advance.

The procedural generation uses algorithms such as <b>Marching Cubes</b> and <b>Cellular Automata</b> to create the caves.

The puzzles are picked from a pool of 6 puzzle types and are integrated in the generated caves.
